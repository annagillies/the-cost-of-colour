                <h2>With affordable makeup still not catering for all, it seems that the beauty world still expects women of colour to pay a premium for their products</h2>

            <h2></h2>
            <p>The launch of Fenty Beauty in 2017 was a revolutionary entrance into the beauty market by its creator, Rihanna. Boasting a foundation range with 40 shades and the slogan ‘Beauty for all’, the cosmetic line wanted to address a problem that has been prominent in the beauty industry for decades: that shade ranges catered to white women and ignored the needs of women of colour.</p>

<p>Fenty Beauty’s efforts to stock a shade to suit every woman is commendable but the reality is their foundations cost £26.00; by no means the most expensive base on the market but not a price tag that puts it in the ‘affordable’ bracket.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>New brands to 2017 Glossier and TheOrdinary provide a good range of shades at a lower price point but they aren’t easy to get hold of. Glossier is available online only and TheOrdinary has one UK store in London’s Covent Garden - it’s hardly the convenience of ‘popping in’ to your local Boots or Superdrug.
</p>

<p>What are the options for women of colour who don’t want to pay more for their beauty products? I asked young women of colour the reality of being a non-white female who wants affordable makeup in an industry that has been catering solely to white women for so long.

            <h3>Han Raja, 21</h3>
            <p>“I only started wearing makeup at university and because I didn’t wear foundation and concealer all the time, I didn’t want to spend a lot on products. I don’t think I was massively aware that my skin colour wasn’t being catered for until I started looking for something that would be suitable for me. </p>

<p>I remember asking my beauty-obsessed (white) housemate to recommend me a budget concealer and she couldn’t think of anything cheap that would be suitable for my skin. Her favourite concealer came in two shades, both of which were very fair. I have found cheaper options but I have to use two concealers to get the colour that is right for me.</p>

<p>Lipstick is another product I find problematic. Finding a nude shade that will suit me is so difficult and the fact that nearly all the advertising of affordable makeup depicts white women doesn’t help. Often I’ll search for an Indian YouTuber who has tried out the lipstick colour I'm interested in to see how it might look on me although there aren’t that many out there.
</p>

<p>I am a member of some Facebook groups for women of colour who want to find suitable products and shades which I find really helpful. People recommend products that work for darker skin-tones."

      <h3>Nish Vasco-Knight, 22</h3>

      <p>“I’ve always used more expensive brands because the affordable shades don’t work for me. In Year 9 I was using the same Maybelline foundation that was popular with my white friends but even the darkest shade was far too light for me – there are still photos where you can see the colour didn’t suit my very dark skin.</p>

      <p>My mum realised there was nothing for my skin-tone so took me to MAC where she knew there’d be something suitable and I’ve bought my foundation from there ever since. Over the last two years I have seen shift in high street brands trying to cater for all skin-tones but personally I’m still sceptical as to whether this is a genuine wish to cater for all women or just an attempt to gain praise for being more ‘diverse’. </p>

      <blockquote>

      </blockquote>

      <p>Cheaper brands such as Sleek and Nyx do quite well in offering a wide shade range so I do use some of their products. I think a big frustration for women of colour is that there are often only three or four colours for non-white skin-tones in comparison to the ten or fifteen for paler skins. It seems brands think three shades should encompass everyone who isn’t white.</p>

      <p>Lipstick is a problem for me too so I always do lots of research before buying it. I think ASOS are great at showcasing the makeup they sell on darker skinned women.”</p>

      <h3>Shrishti Suresh, 22</h3>
      <p>“My early experiences of buying high street makeup made me really conscious that I’m an ethnic minority. I’ve been raised in a traditional Indian family and always felt proud of my heritage but my experiences of makeup shopping with my friends when I was younger made me start to view my ethnicity as a bad thing.</p>

<p>I remember my white friends had so much to choose from while there was only one option for me and even then it wasn’t quite right. I turned to more expensive make up quite early on finding brands like Clinique and Smashbox worked well for me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are fantastic women of colour communities on Facebook; I love the group ‘Beauty of Colour’ who take a lot of time to find affordable alternatives to expensive products. I think a lot of women of colour do still opt to use more expensive brands as most affordable brands don’t pay attention to the variations in tone of darker skins, for example the difference between yellow and cool undertones.”</p>


<h3>Aiswarya Manoj, 22</h3>
<p>“I personally prefer to spend more money on beauty products as I can afford to and I enjoy using luxury products.
</p>

<p>In my experience a lot of the darker shades carried by affordable brands are either too ashy or dark in colour for my skin and so often I’d need to mix two to get the right colour which defeats the object of buying cheaper makeup if you need to purchase two shades!”</p>

<h3>Ruth Butler, 22</h3>
<p>“My sister and I have moaned about affordable makeup for years. I live in a very white area and so the darkest shade in my local Boots has always been ‘Ivory’. </p>

<blockquote>
  Even if the brand carries a dark shade you can’t guarantee it’s going to be stocked in the shops near to you.<em></em>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if the brand carries a dark shade you can’t guarantee it’s going to be stocked in the shops near to you. I’ve had to order online which is never ideal as you can’t test the colour.</p>

<p>All the cheaper brands I’ve tried in the past make their shades too orange for my skin. I remember getting my makeup done for my prom a few years ago in MAC and it was the first time I’d seen a foundation on my skin that wasn’t too orange or too thick.”</p>

  <h3>The Verdict</h3>
<p>It seems that although some affordable brands are widening the options for women of colour, the beauty world isn’t much closer to achieving a level playing field. Let’s hope the success of Fenty Beauty has set an example that will be replicated among affordable brands in the future…</p>
